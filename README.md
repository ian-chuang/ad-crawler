**Observations:**
* Some of these seem to be for collecting user data and how they interact with the site. 
* Sohu.com, pinimg.com, baidu.com are dropped from the top 10 after adblock is applied
* Pinimg.com, awsstatic.com seem to see an increase after adblock
<br />

* Itc.cn, baidu.com, baidustatic.com, wsimg.com seem to have dropped by a decent amount.
* Media.net, alicdn.com, adobedtm.com, forbesimg.com, see some small drops but still have the highest requests after adblock.
